/**
 * This program should be used to demonstrate the use of Version Control
 * Systems.
 *
 * Note that VCS tooling should be used to demonstrate these capabilities.
 * There is *no need* to interact with a VCS programmatically.
 *
 * 1) Initialize a Git repository (you may use SVN or Hg if needed)
 * 2) Establish a conventional structure in the repo:
 *        e.g. master & develop for Git, trunk, tags, and branches for SVN
 * 3) Commit the current file (or all files) to the VCS
 * 4) Create a new branch in the repository
 * 5) Make a change to the current file
 * 6) Commit your change to the new branch
 * 7) Catch-up your branch with the stable branch of the repo
 *        e.g rebase in Git, catch-up merge in SVN
 * 8) Merge your branch into the stable branch of the repo
 * 9) Create a tag for the result
 *
 * Please *feel free* to use Google during this test.
